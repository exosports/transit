Transit, a code to solve for the radiative-transfer equation for planetary atmospheres.  

This project was completed with the support of the NASA Planetary Atmospheres Program, grant NNX12AI69G, held by Principal Investigator Joseph Harrington. Principal developers in- cluded graduate students Patricio E. Cubillos and Jasmina Blecic, programmer Madison Stemm, and undergraduate Andrew S. D. Foster. The included ’transit’ radiative transfer code is based on an earlier program of the same name written by Patricio Rojo (Univ. de Chile, Santiago) when he was a graduate student at Cornell University under Joseph Harrington.
