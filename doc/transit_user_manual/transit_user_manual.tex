\subsection{Transit Package Overview}

{\tt Transit} is a C code, written in a modular, object-oriented
style.  It was originally developed at Cornell University by Patricio
Rojo, a former Ph.D. student of Dr. Joseph Harrington.  The code
handled the case of transmission spectrum, where stellar light is
absorbed as it travels tangentially across the limb of a planetary
atmosphere, as observed during an exoplanet transit observation.
Subsequently, we ---the exoplanet group at the University of Central
Florida--- have modified the code to add planetary emission spectra
calculation (as observed during a secondary-eclipse observation),
include multiple opacity line lists, and incorporate it to the
Bayesian Atmospheric Radiative Transfer
(\href{https://github.com/joeharr4/BART} {\tttm
  BART}\footnote{github.com/joeharr4/BART}) project, which constrains
exoplanet atmospheric properties in a Bayesian framework, given a set
of eclipse or transit-depth measurements.
  

{\tttm BART} combines {\tt Transit} with the Thermochemical
Equilibrium Abundances (\href{https://github.com/dzesmin/TEA} {\tttm
  TEA}\footnote{github.com/dzesmin/TEA}) module, which calculates
abundances of gaseous species, and the Multi-Core Markov-chain Monte
Carlo (\href{https://github.com/pcubillos/MCcubed} {\tttm
  MCcubed}\footnote{github.com/pcubillos/MCcubed}) statistical module,
which assesses the temperature and molecular-abundances posterior
distributions, given a set of observations.

The current {\tttm Transit} package consists of three main modules:
{\transit} \findme{change name to {\tttm RT}}, a C module that
calculates the emission or transmission spectrum for a planetary
atmosphere by solving the radiative-transfer equation.
{\tttm pu}, a library of C utility functions used by {\transit}.
{\pylineread}, a Python module that converts molecular line-opacity
information (line transitions and partition functions)
from online-available databases into the transit line information
(TLI) format for later use by {\transit}. \newline

\noindent The Transit module is organized as follow:

\section{Quick Walkthrough}
\label{sec:walkthrough}

Transit consists of three packages --- pylineread, transit, and pu---.
The pylineread and transit packages provide the program executables to
calculate an atmospheric spectrum, the pu package provides utility
functions for the transit package.  The pylineread and transit
programs allow for command-line arguments or a configuration file
(preferred) to configure the calculation specifics (e.g, spectrum
sampling boundaries, resolution, input and output file locations and
names, verbosity, etc).

The spectrum calculation is broken in two steps: first, pylineread
processes species line-transition information files (as downloaded
from online databases), extract the necessary data, and writes it to a
binary transition-line-information (TLI) file.  Then the transit
program computes the spectra for the given atmospheric model and
species opacities.

The inputs for pylineread are (1) the line-transition database files
of the species of interest, and (2) their corresponding
partition-function files.  Pylineread outputs a binary TLI file with
the line-transitions' wavelength, lower-state energy, oscillator
strength, and isotpe index; and a tabulated list of partition-function
values as a function of temperature.

The inputs for transit are (1) an atmospheric file, (2) a TLI file
(output from pylineread), (3) one or more cross-section (CS) file,
(4) a molecular information file, and optionally (5) an opacity file.
See section \ref{sec:input-transit} for further details on the transit
input files and their required formats.

The atmospheric file defines the atmospheric model, indicating the
species present, and their physical properties (radius, pressure,
temperature, and species mole mixing ratio) given in a layer-by-layer
style.  The input TLI file is the output from pylineread.  The CS
file is a tabulated list of opacities as function of wavenumber
and temperature.  The molecular information file contains additional
species properties, is not expected to change (mass and collision
diameter).  This file is provided by the Transit module.  The optional
opacity file provides a tabulated list of line-transition opacities,
as a function of temperature, pressure, and wavenumber, for each
species.  This file can be computed by the transit prgram and further
used as input to speed up the calculations (interpolate instead of
doing the line-by-line calculation).

The main output of the transit program is the atmospheric spectrum.
For transit geometry, transit computes the transmission spectrum,
returning the modulation spectrum (Rp/Rs as function of wavelength).
For eclipse geometry, transit computes the emission intensity spectrum
for a set of incident angles, combining them to return a hemisphere
integrated flux spectrum.  Additional (optional) outputs are (2) the
opacity file (see above), (3) a `toomuch' file with the layer at which
the optical deth reached a specified maximum threshold, (4) a sampling
file with information on the wavelength and layer sampling, and for
eclipse geometry, (5) the intensity emission spectra as a function of
incident angle.  See section \ref{sec:tran-out} for further details on
the output files.


\section{Program Inputs}
\label{sec:inputs}

This Section describes the command-line arguments and input files
required by the the {\pylineread} and {\transit} modules, and any
additional information needed to properly configure the modules.

\subsection{Pylineread}
\label{sec:inp-pyline}

The executable {\tttm transit/pylineread/src/pylineread.py} is the
main {\pylineread} routine.  {\pylineread} runs from the shell taking a
set of command-line arguments.  Alternatively, the command-line
arguments can be specified using a configuration file.  
Before running {\pylineread}, the user needs to obtain two types of
input files: opacity line-list database files and partition-function files.

\subsubsection{Pylineread Command-Line Arguments}

To display the complete list of command-line arguments, cd into the
{\pylineread} source folder ({\tttm transit/pylineread/src}) and
execute: \newline
{\tttb ./pylineread.py {-}{-}help} \\

{\bf Optional Arguments:} \newline
\argument{-h, {-}{-}help}{Show the help message and exit.}

\argument{-c FILE, {-}{-}config\_file FILE}{Configuration filename
  (string).}

\argument{-v VERB, {-}{-}verbose-level VERB}{Verbosity level
  (Integer) [default: 2].}

\argument{-q, {-}{-}quiet}{Set verbosity level to 1.}

{\bf Database Arguments:} \newline
\argument{-o OUTPUT, {-}{-}output OUTPUT}{Output TLI filename (string)
  [default: 'output.tli'].}

\argument{-d DB\_LIST, {-}{-}database DB\_LIST}{Path (string) to the input
  line-transition database file(s).}

\argument{-p PART\_LIST, {-}{-}partition PART\_LIST}{Path (string) to the
  auxiliary partition-function file(s).}

\argument{-t DBTYPE, {-}{-}dbtype DBTYPE}{Database type (string). 
  'ps' for Partridge \& Schwenke's H2O; 'hit' for HITRAN and
  HITEMP; or 'ts' for Schwenke's TiO.}

{\bf Wavelength Arguments:} \newline
\argument{-i IWAV, {-}{-}wav-init IWAV}{Initial wavelength (microns)
  [default: 1.0].}

\argument{-f FWAV, {-}{-}wav-final FWAV}{Final wavelength (microns)
  [default: 2.0].}


\subsubsection{Configuration File}
\label{sec:pylinecfg}

A configuration file presents an alternative to the command-line
arguments to specify the input variables.  The examples folder ({\tttm
  transit/pylineread/examples/}) provides a configuration-file sample,
{\tttm pyline\_example.cfg}, and is further explained below: \newline

\begin{plain}
[Parameters]
# Multiple-value arguments can be set separated either by a white space or
# a line break.

# This is the list (and source) of the currently supported Line Lists:
# Partridge and Schwenke (H2O):
#   - http://kurucz.harvard.edu/molecules/h2o/h2ofastfix.bin
# HITRAN and HITEMP:
#   - http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/hitran/

#   - Total Internal Partition Sums (TIPS) *
#   - http://kurucz.harvard.edu/molecules/tio/tiopart.dat
# (*): Transit incorporates a modified version of the TIPS code

# Path(s) to the database line lists:
# (assuming that the user put the files in a databases folder)
db_list  = .../databases/Schwenke-H2O/h2ofastfix.bin
           .../databases/HITEMP/CO2/02_2500-3000_HITEMP2010.par

# Path(s) to the partition function files:
part_list= .../databases/Schwenke-H2O/h2opartfn.dat
           implicit

# Type of each input database:
#   hit:  HITRAN and HITEMP
#   ps:   Partridge and Schwenke H2O
#   ts:   Schwenke TiO
dbtype   = ps hit

# The output filename
output   = PSandHIT_2.0-4.0um.tli

# Initial wavelength in microns:
iwav     = 2.0

# Final wavelength in microns:
fwav     = 4.0

# Verbosity level (max number 20)
verb     = 10
\end{plain} 
\vspace{10pt}

{\pylineread}'s configuration files follow the
\href{https://docs.python.org/2/library/configparser.html}
{ConfigParser}\footnote{docs.python.org/2/library/configparser.html}
format.  The {\tttm[Parameters]} line defines the section read by
ConfigParser.  Multiple arguments can be separated either with blank
spaces or put in separated lines.  The db\_list, part\_list, and
dbtype arguments must have the same number of values, and should be
input in the corresponding order.  We recommend that the output name
carry a {\tttm .tli} extension.

\subsubsection{Opacity Line-List Files}

\subsubsection{HITRAN Data File}

The HITRAN data file, {\tttm transit/pylineread/inputs/hitran.dat},
is an additional file used by {\pylineread} to obtain known physical
properties of the species from the HTRAN and HITEMP databases.  This
file is automatically read by {\pylineread} and, thus, does not need
to be given as an argument.  There is also no need to modify this file
by the user, as the information included does not vary.  The layout of
the {\tttm hitran.dat} is given below: \newline

\begin{plain}

\subsection{Transit}
\label{sec:input-transit}

The executable {\tttm transit/transit/transit} is the main
{\transit} program.  {\transit} runs from the shell taking a set of
command-line arguments.  Alternatively, the command-line arguments can
be specified using a configuration file.  Before running {\transit},
the user needs to obtain three types of input files, an atmospheric
file, transit-line information (TLI) files (created by {\pylineread}),
and cross-section (CS) files (e.g., for collision-induced absorption).  Additionally,
{\transit} uses a molecules data file (included in the code).  Lastly,
an optional opacity file can be used to provide a pre-calculated table
of opacities (this file can be created by {\transit} itself).

\subsubsection{Transit Command-Line Arguments}

\paragraph{Spectrum Wavenumber Sampling}

Internally, {\tt transit} samples the spectrum in a equi-spaced
wavenumber space, in CGS units.  However, the user can specify the
spectrum boundaries either in wavenumber or wavelength.  The `{\tttb
  wnfct}' and `{\tttb wlfct}' arguments allow the user to specify the
units of the input wavenumber and wavelength variables, respectively.

{\transit} implements a `dynamic' wavenumber sampling, adjusting the
sampling at each layer to avoid oversampling or undersampling the line
Voigt profiles, allowing for an efficient extinction coefficient
calculation at all layers (see Figure \ref{fig:broadening}).

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centerline{
\includegraphics[width=0.55\textwidth, clip]{figs/widths.pdf}}
\caption{\small \label{fig:broadening} Doppler and Lorentz half-width
  at half maximum (HWHM) line broadening for the water molecule at 11
  {\microns}, for a H$\sb{2}$/He-dominated atmosphere.  Since the
  Lorentz profile width is proportional to the pressure, the Voigt
  profile HWHM varies over several orders of magnitude between the top
  and bottom of the atmosphere.}
\end{figure}
% SOURCE:  /home/patricio/ast/esp01/bart/transit/develop/plots/widths.py

The `{\tttb wndelt}' argument defines the `coarse' sampling interval
($\Delta\nu\sb{\rm c}$), which is the sampling of the output spectra.
Together with the oversampling-factor argument, `{\tttb wnosamp}',
{\transit} defines the `fine' sampling interval as: $\Delta\nu\sb{\rm
  f}$ = {\tttb wndelt / wnosamp}.  The dynamic sampling interval
($\Delta\nu\sb{\rm d}$) lies between the fine and coarse sampling
interval.

Initially, Transit pre-computes Voigt profiles, for a set of Lorentz
and Doppler widths, over the fine sampling.  Then, these profiles are
decimated to the dynamic sampling to calculate the extinction
coefficient.  Lastly, the extinction coefficient is downsampled to the
coarse sampling.  This requires that the dynamic sampling be an
integer factor of the fine sampling ($\Delta\nu\sb{\rm d} =
f\sb{1}\Delta\nu\sb{\rm f}$, with $f\sb{1}\in\mathbb{N}$), and the
coarse sampling be an integer factor of the dynamical sampling
($\Delta\nu\sb{\rm c} = f\sb{2}\Delta\nu\sb{\rm d}$, with
$f\sb{2}\in\mathbb{N}$).  Noting that {\tttb wnosamp} $=
f\sb{1}f\sb{2}$, favorable values of {\tttb wnosamp} are thus numbers
with a large number of integer divisors.

The `{\tttb resolv}' argument \findme{not implement yet} sets the minimum
number of spectral points to sample a profile's HWHM, determining the
dynamic sampling interval for each layer.
Given the wavenumber range and the layer's temperature, pressure, and
composition, {\transit} calculates the thinnest HWHM (HWHM$\sb{\rm
  min}$), then {\transit} selects the largest integer divisor of
{\tttm `wnosamp'} ($d\sb{\rm max}$) that resolves HWHM$\sb{\rm min}$:
\begin{equation}
  \Delta\nu\sb{\rm d} =    d\sb{\rm max}\ \Delta\nu\sb{\rm f} 
                      \leq \frac{\rm HWHM\sb{min}}{\tttm \rm{resolv}}.
\end{equation}

% As long as the fine sampling interval can resolve the thinnest lines
% in the atmosphere, the extinction coefficient will be well calculated.
% The user must make sure that $\Delta\nu\sb{\rm f}$ is narrow enough to
% resolve any line profile in the atmosphere.


\paragraph{Atmospheric-Layer  Sampling}

By default, {\transit} uses the atmospheric file's layer sampling.  If
the user sets the `{\tttb raddelt}' argument, the layers will be
resampled to an equi-spaced radius sampling.  The radius boundaries
can also be redefined with the `{\tttb radhigh}' and `{\tttb radlow}'
arguments.

\paragraph{Extinction-Coefficient Calculation}
\label{sec:opacity}

{\tt Transit} has an option to calculate the extinction coefficient on
the spot (line-by-line calculation) for each layer, or interpolate
from a pre-calculated table of opacities.

By setting the `{\tttb opacityfile}' argument, the user chooses to
interpolate from the specified opacity table.  If the file does not
exist, {\tt Transit} will compute (and save) the
extinction-coefficient table over a grid of wavenumber, pressure,
temperature, and species arrays.  The wavenumber is taken from the
coarse wavenumber sampling.  The pressure array is taken from the
atmospheric layers.  The list of species will be taken from the TLI
file.  The temperature array will be computed as a linear sample from
{\tttb `tlow'} to {\tttb `thigh'} with sampling interval {\tttb
  `tempdelt'}.  If the opacity file exists, {\transit} will check that
the table's wavenumber, pressure, and species list match those
specified by the command-line arguments.

% If the user uses a pre-calculated opacity table, the code will
% interpolate the extinction coefficient from the sampled temperatures
% to the atmospheric layer's temperature.

Typical runtimes (for a 100-layers atmosphere, 5 million lines, from 3
to 11 {\microns}) to calculate a spectrum with an existing opacity
file (interpolation), on the spot (line-by-line calculation), or to
generate the opacity file requires a few seconds, minutes, and hours,
respectively.

\paragraph{Line-by-Line Calculation}

The line-by-line calculation of the extinction coefficient (see the
theory document) will only consider the contribution from the lines
which strength is larger than $S\sb{\rm max} \times$ {\tttb ethresh},
with $S\sb{\rm max}$ the maximum line-strength in a given layer.

\paragraph{Voigt-Profile Calculation}

The Voigt profiles used in the line-by-line extinction-coefficient
calculation are pre-calculated in a 2D table for a range of
Doppler and Lorentz widths.  The Doppler range is a log-spaced sample
of `{\tttb ndop}' widths from `{\tttb dmin}' to `{\tttb dmax}'.
Likewise, the Lorentz range is a log-spaced sample
of `{\tttb nlor}' widths from `{\tttb lmin}' to `{\tttb lmax}'.
The `{\tttm nwidth}' argument indicates how far from the central
wavenumber (in number of profile half-widths) to calculate the Voigt
profile.

\paragraph{Cloud Opacity}

Transit allows for a basic gray-opacity (cloud) layer.  For a simple 
cloud model, {\tttm `cloudtop'} defines a cloudtop pressure (in 
base-10 logarithm), and all layers with pressures greater than that 
have an opaque cloud.  For a more complex cloud, {\tttm `cloud'} defines 
a cloud type (constant extinction, or constant opacity), an extinction/opacity 
value, the log10 cloudtop pressure, and the log10 cloud bottom pressure.  
Between the cloudtop and cloud bottom, the extinction/opacity is constant.  
Above or below the cloud, extinction is zero.

\paragraph{Scattering}

Transit allows for two basic scattering models.  Setting 
{\tttm `scattering = polar'} uses the polarizability method of the NASA 
Planetary Spectrum Generator, which uses experimental data in an analytical 
formula (no free parameters).  Setting {\tttm `scattering'} to a float value 
will use the approximation method of Lecavelier Des Etangs et al.~(2008), 
which is applicable to a H2 atmosphere.  This float value defines the 
power-of-ten scaling factor for the scattering extinction.



\subsubsection{Configuration File}
\label{sec:transitcfg}

A configuration file presents an alternative to the command-line
arguments to specify the input variables.  The following example
({\tttb transit/run/config\_sample.cfg}) shows the format of a basic
transit configuration file, which is further explained below: \newline

\begin{plain}

\end{plain}

{\transit}'s configuration file has its own format.  Comment lines
start with the {\tttm \#} character.  When setting an argument--value
pair, do not include the `equal' sign in between.  String values do
not need the quotation marks.

\subsubsection{Atmospheric File}
\label{atm-file}

The atmospheric file is a plain text file that determines the species
present in the atmosphere and the physical properties of the
atmospheric layers (pressure, radius, temperature, and mole mixing
ratio of the species) assuming a 1D plane-parallel model.  See below
(and {\tt transit/examples/example01/sample.atm} \findme{add file to
  repo} for an atmospheric file sample: \newline

\begin{plain}

\end{plain}

The atmospheric file follows the following format: Blank and comment
lines (starting with the `{\tt \#}' character) are allowed and ignored
by transit.  The `{\tt ur}' and `{\tt up}' keywords set the radius and
pressure units (conversion factors to CGS), respectively.  For
example, if the radii are given in km ($=10\sp{5}$ cm), set `{\tt ur
  1e5}'.  The `{\tt q}' keyword indicate if the abundances are given
by mass or by number.  The line after `{\tttm\#SPECIES}' lists the
species in the atmosphere.  The `{\tttm\#TEADATA}' line indicates where the
atmospheric data per layer starts.  The file contains one layer's information
per line (in descending pressure order).  Each line contains the
radius, pressure, temperature, and mole mixing ratio for each layer.
The file can be produced using the BART routines (see
\href{https://github.com/joeharr4/BART}{github.com/joeharr4/BART} and
documentation therein).

\subsubsection{Transit Line Information (TLI) File}
\label{sec:TLItransit}

The TLI file is a binary file that provides the species'
line-transition information (central wavelength, lower-state energy,
and weighted oscillator strength), mass, isotopic ratio, and a
tabulated partition-function array as function of temperature for each
one.  The TLI file is the output of the {\pylineread} module.

\subsubsection{Cross-section File}

The cross-section files provide tabulated absorption data for
Transit (e.g., for collision-induced absorption, CIA).  CIA data can be obtained from Aleksandra Borysow's webpage
(\href{http://www.astro.ku.dk/~aborysow/programs/index.html}
{astro.ku.dk/{\sim}aborysow/programs/index.html}).
See below (and {\tttm
  transit/inputs/CIA\_H2H2\_400-7000K.dat}) for a CS file sample:
\newline
\begin{plain}
# CIA Header for H2-H2:

\end{plain}

A valid CS file is a plain text file that contains a
header and a main body.  Comment lines (starting with the `{\tttm \#}'
character) and blank lines are allowed and ignored by {\transit}.  The
header must contain two keyword arguments.  A line starting with the
`{\tttm i}' keyword contains the name of the species separated by
blank spaces (names should match those from the atmospheric file).  A
line starting with the `{\tttm t}' keyword contains the list of
temperatures (blank-space separated, in Kelvin degrees) sampled in the
CS file.

The body of the CS file contains a tabulated list with the absorption
coefficients (in units of cm$\sp{-1}$ amagat$\sp{-2}$ for CIA data,
or cm$\sp{-1}$ amagat$\sp{-1}$ for line-transition data) evaluated as a
function of wavenumber (in units of cm$\sp{-1}$) and temperature.
Each line contains the wavenumber (first column) and the coefficient
corresponding to the temperatures specified in the header (values
blank-space separated).

\subsubsection{Opacity File}
\label{sec:opac-file}

The opacity file is a binary file that contains a tabulated grid of
extinction coefficients as function of wavenumber, for each species
with a line list, and for a range of pressures and temperatures.  If
specified, {\transit} will use this table to interpolate the
extinction coefficient at the temperatures given by the atmospheric
profile.  The opacity- and atmospheric-file's pressure arrays must
coincide.  Likewise, the {\tt transit} and the opacity-file's
wavenumber arrays must also coincide.  Similarly, all species in the
TLI file must be contained in the opacity file.  See Section
\ref{sec:opacity}.
% The opacity array contains the calculated extinction coefficients
% with the broadening function divided by the abundances
% \citep[see][]{CubillosEtal2015bart}.


\subsubsection{Molecules Data File}

The molecules data file ({\tt transit/inputs/molecules.dat})
defines a universal ID, mass, polarizability, and (collision) diameter for the
species in the atmosphere.
The layout of the {\tt molecules.dat} file is given below: \newline

\section{Program Outputs}
\label{sec:outputs}

\subsection{Pylineread Output}
\label{sec:pyline-out}

The output of the {\pylineread} module is a TLI file, described in
Section \ref{sec:TLItransit}.

\subsection{Transit Output}
\label{sec:tran-out}

The {\transit} module produces up to five output files: the opacity,
the flux spectrum, the intensity spectrum, the sampling information,
and the max optical-depth files.

\subsubsection{Opacity File}
See Section \ref{sec:opac-file}.

\subsubsection{Flux Spectrum File}

This file contains the calculated modulation (transit geometry) or
hemisphere-integrated emission (eclipse geometry) spectrum.  The first
column shows the wavelength (in {\microns}) and the second column the
spectrum (unitless for transit, erg\,s$\sp{-1}$cm$\sp{-1}$ for
eclipse).  The following example shows this file's layout for an
eclipse run:

\begin{plain}
#wvl [um]      Flux [erg/s/cm]
11             50317.47

    ...           ...
\end{plain} 
\phantom{.\\}% white space after the plain
\findme{change -Flux to something more reasonable}.

\subsubsection{Intensity Spectrum File}

This file contains the calculated intensity spectrum at each incident
angle (for eclipse geometry).  The first column has the wavelength (in
{\microns}) and the subsequent columns the planetary emission
intensity (in erg\,s$\sp{-1}$cm$\sp{-1}$sr$\sp{-1}$) for each of the
angles specified by the `{\tttb raygrid}' argument.  The following
example shows the layout of this file:

\begin{plain}
#wvl [um]  I[ 0.0 deg]  I[30.0 deg]  I[60.0 deg]  I[80.0 deg]  [erg/s/cm/sr]

\end{plain}  
\phantom{.\\}  % white space after the plain

\subsubsection{Sampling Information File}

This file stores the wavenumber, radius, and impact parameter sampling
information.  Each sampling shows the conversion factor to cgs units,
the initial and final sampling values, the spacing interval between
samples, the number of elements, the wavenumber sampling's oversample
factor, and the radius sampling's list of values for radius.  The
following example shows the layout of this file:
\begin{plain}
############################

\subsubsection{Max Optical-Depth File}

This file contains the atmospheric layer's
radius where the optical depth reached {\tttm toomuch}, as a function
of wavelength.  The following example shows the layout of this file:
\begin{plain}
# Wavelength   Max Optical   Radius at the    Radius

\section{Running Transit}
\label{sec:running}

\subsection{Running Pylineread}
\label{sec:runpyline}

We strongly suggest the use a configuration file to specify the
command-line arguments.  In that way, the user has a record of the
arguments used to create the TLI files.  The example provided in
\texttt{transit/pylineread/examples/} is further described in
Section \ref{sec:pylinecfg}.

{\pylineread} can be run from any folder, provided the user gives the
path from the working folder to the executable.  We recommend to
create a folder exclusively to execute {\pylineread} and hold its
results.  For example, to run {\pylineread} from a folder located in
{\tttm transit/pylineread/TLI/} using a configuration file, cd into
{\tttm transit/pylineread/} and execute from the shell: \newline
{\tttb mkdir TLI} \\
{\tttb cd TLI/}   \\
{\tttb cp ../examples/pyline\_example.cfg pyline\_run\_01.cfg} \\
(Edit the configuration file arguments following the format from
  Section \ref{sec:pylinecfg}) \\
{\tttb ../src/pylineread.py -c pyline\_run\_01.cfg} \\

\subsection{Running Transit}

{\transit} runs in the same way as {\pylineread}.  Thus, the same
recommendations from Section \ref{sec:runpyline} apply.  Although
{\transit} has many command-line arguments, in most cases, most of
them can be left as defaults.  A minimal example is given in {\tttm
  transit/run/transit\_example.cfg}. For example, to run {\transit}
using a configuration file from the {\tttm transit/run/} folder, cd
into that folder and execute from the shell:\newline
{\tttb cp config\_sample.cfg  transit\_run\_01.cfg} \\
(Edit the configuration file arguments following the format from
  Section \ref{sec:transitcfg}) \\
{\tttb ../transit/transit -c transit\_run\_01.cfg} \\

\subsection{Utilizing Shared Memory}
\label{sec:sharedmem}

{\transit} optionally utilizes IPC shared memory to store the opacity
grid (see \ref{sec:opacity}). This is useful when multiple {\transit}
processes are running with the same {\tttb opacityFile}.

\subsubsection{System Requirements}

There are numerous system requirements related to the use of shared
memory:

\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{0ex}
\setlength\topsep{0ex}
\setlength\partopsep{0ex}
\setlength\parsep{0ex}
\item System V Interprocess Communication (IPC) support. This can be
      found on most modern distributions of Linux, as well as Mac OS X.
\item Presence of {\tttm sys/ipc.h} and {\tttm sys/shm.h} system libraries.
\item Sufficient size allowances by the OS (see below).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Size Allowances}

The operating system places restrictions on the total amount of shared
memory that may be used by one process and by all processes together.
Prior to running {\transit} with shared memory, please consider the
following: \newline

\noindent
{\bf To check the current size allowances} (reported in bytes): \\
\\
On Linux: \\
{\tttm cat /proc/sys/kernel/shmmax} \\
{\tttm cat /proc/sys/kernel/shmall} \\
\\
On Mac OS X: \\
{\tttm sysctl -h kern.sysv.shmmax} \\
{\tttm sysctl -h kern.sysv.shmall} \\

\bigskip
\noindent
{\bf To temporarily set the current size allowances} (until next reboot): \\
\\
On Linux: \\
{\tttm [sudo] echo [size in bytes] > /proc/sys/kernel/shmmax} \\
{\tttm [sudo] echo [size in bytes] > /proc/sys/kernel/shmall} \\
\\
On Mac OS X: \\
{\tttm [sudo] sysctl -h kern.sysv.shmmax=[size in bytes]} \\
{\tttm [sudo] sysctl -h kern.sysv.shmall=[size in bytes]} \\

\bigskip
\noindent
{\bf To set the size allowances automatically} (after reboot): \\
\\
On Linux, add the following lines to {\tttm /etc/sysctl.conf}: \\
{\tttm kernel.shmmax=[size in bytes]} \\
{\tttm kernel.shmall=[size in bytes]} \\
\\
On Max OS X, add the following lines to {\tttm /etc/sysctl.conf}: \\
{\tttm kern.sysv.shmmax=[size in bytes]} \\
{\tttm kern.sysv.shmall=[size in bytes]} \\

\subsubsection{Cleaning Up}

Transit marks its shared memory segments for destruction as soon as
possible to avoid cases in which segments remain reserved after the
program completes. However, it is possible that a Transit process that
is interrupted at exactly the wrong moment will leave behind a segment
of memory. Because shared memory is reserved by the system, and not
any specific process, it will remain unusable until the system reboots.

You can manually check for and remove shared memory segments if you
suspect that segments have been left behind: \newline

\noindent
{\bf To check for segments}: \\
\\
On Linux: \\
{\tttm ipcs -m} \\
\\
On Mac OS X: \\
{\tttm ipcs -am} \\

\medskip
It is common to have several shared memory segments reserved during typical
use of your computer. Because of this, identifying segments that belong
Transit is not always trivial. You can narrow down the search by considering
the user running Transit, the number of Transit processes using the given
opacity file, and the size of the segments: for each opacity file, Transit
will reserve one segment of several dozen (48) bytes to hold meta information
and a larger segment (approximately the size of the opacity file) to hold
the opacity grid. \newline

\noindent
{\bf To remove a segment using its ID}: \\
\\
On Linux and Mac OS X: \\
{\tttm ipcrm -m [id]} \\

\section{FAQ}

This section will contain some common questions and/or pitfalls when running Transit.

\begin{faq}
  \item[How many layers should be included in the atmospheric model?]
    Generally, 100 layers is sufficient for most problems.  However, the exact number will depend on the exact setup being executed.  Users can test whether the model has "enough" layers by re-running the particular scenario with twice as many layers in the atmospheric model.
  \item[How should the atmospheric model layers be spaced?]
    We recommend using layers that are uniformly spaced according to the logarithm of the pressure.  Using non-uniformly-spaced layers can produce undesired behavior when integrating the extinction.
  \item[I want to use ExoMol line lists, but they are too large.  What can I do?]
    Patricio Cubillos has provided compressed ExoMol line lists which are readily available for use by Transit's pylineread module.  You can find those \href{https://zenodo.org/record/3768504}{here}.
  \item[I have a question that isn't answered here.  Where should I ask it?]
    The \href{https://physics.ucf.edu/mailman/listinfo/bart-user}{BART-user mailing list} will likely result in the quickest reply.  Alternatively, open an issue on Github.

\section{Reproducible Research}
% FINDME: is this a sufficient description?

Transit is made available under the Reproducible Research Software License.  
This license requires any publications that use Transit to be accompanied by a Reproducible research Compendium (RRC). 
The RRC includes the exact version of Transit used (including any local edits made), the inputs, and the outputs.  
The RRC should enable the user to re-run the exact analysis that was performed in the publication.  
This typically requires some file(s) with the commands necessary to reproduce the work and a way to execute those commands (e.g., shell script, Makefile).  
Intermediary files (e.g., line lists, TLI file) may be omitted, provided that they are deterministic and can be re-created with provided scripts.
The RRC must be hosted at a permanent location (e.g., Github, Zenodo) and referenced in the publication (e.g., footnote with hyperlink).
For examples, see the BART papers linked above and the RRC references therein.
